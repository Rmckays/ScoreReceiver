# ScoreReceiver

### Summary
---
Score Receiver allows users to find game data from the NFL for the last 30 years.  The back-end is built using Python Flask with a REST API interface
that serves the game data to a React/Redux front-end.  The NFL game data is retrieved and read using Python from this [Github Repo](https://github.com/fivethirtyeight/nfl-elo-game/blob/master/data/nfl_games.csv).
